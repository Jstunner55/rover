\section{Description}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this system is to provide a reliable and efficient solution for managing core operational tasks while maintaining ease of use for end users.
\subsection{Scope}
This document outlines the functional, performance, and reliability requirements necessary to support the system's intended operation across all deployment environments.
\subsection{Overview}
The system consists of modular components responsible for data processing, user interaction, and system monitoring, each designed to operate cohesively within the defined constraints.

\section{Specific Requirements}

\subsection{Functionality}
The system shall process input data, generate corresponding outputs, and provide essential user feedback through an interactive interface.
\subsection{Performance}
The system shall operate with a maximum response time of 200 ms under normal load and maintain performance across typical usage scenarios.
\subsection{Reliability}
The system shall maintain an uptime of at least 99\% and recover gracefully from unexpected faults or interruptions.
\subsection{Design Constraints}
The design shall adhere to specified hardware limitations, comply with applicable standards, and remain compatible with existing interfaces.
\subsection{States and Modes}
The system shall operate in three primary modes: initialization, normal operation, and error recovery, transitioning between states based on defined event triggers.
